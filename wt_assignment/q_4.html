        <p1>Established in 1999 under the auspices of Mata Leelawati Shikshan Sansthan (MLSS), a registered educational society dedicated
             to philanthropic endeavours. The Institute (IITM) has established a strong foundation for academic excellence. Guided by the 
             visionary leadership of Shri T.N. Chaturvedi, a recipient of the prestigious Padma Vibhushan, India's second-highest civilian 
             honour, IITM embarked on its journey with Shri. Chaturvedi serving as both the founding President of the society and the
